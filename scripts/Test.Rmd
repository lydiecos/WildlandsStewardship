## R Markdown


```{r cars}
kbl(cars) %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "2in")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
